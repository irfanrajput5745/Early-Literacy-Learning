                        <h2>Neuron NETWORKS</h2>
                        <p>Neurons are not loners, no they must always be chatting away to other neurons. Their synapses firing together create an extensive communication network, these pathways in the central nervous system are responsible for the functions of the brain. Billions of neurons are talking together as they send and receive messages throughout the body daily. The actual number of synapses is said to be in the trillions—or MORE! That does make one stop and think! Oops, just fired off more synapses!
                        </p>
                        <p>Infants have 86 billion neurons available but the
                            messaging pathways are in need of development. .Each newborn 
                            fires about 2,500 synapses per neuron, at age 3 it’s up to nearly 
                            15,000 synapses per neuron firing away. That’s an enormous difference 
                            and it’s why this time is so important! </p>
                            <p>What happened during those early years? The brain expands both in size and capabilities. When a baby bursts into the world its brain size is only 25% of that of an adults. By the third year the brain has increased its size to 80%, the physical shape and weight of the brain is nearly complete by age 
                                five at 92%.

                        <h3>The Brain and I</h3>
                        <p>During my early teaching years there were two separate roads, one the scientific study of the
                            brain called neuroscience, and the other best teaching practices—never the two did meet!
                            This meant that a teacher who was working closely with 30 students daily didn’t know how the
                            brain worked or really learned. Teachers relied on their initial college education,
                            classroom observations, district workshops and on the job trial & error experiences to
                            improve their teaching</p>
                        <p> In the 90’s this began to shift. Early Childhood Educational conferences began to offer
                            presentations on the brain. Dr. Patricia Wolfe, an educator was one of the pioneers leading
                            the charge to have these two important roads intersect. Her love for scientific brain
                            research had started her on a new lifetime journey—similar to Johnny Appleseed --spreading
                            her knowledge of brain research and its relationship to teaching. She is a well-known author
                            of numerous books and has traveled the world!
                        </p>
                        <p> I was lucky enough to attend one of her talks at a conference and became excited about the
                            new brain research connected to learning. Months later I was accepted to be part of a
                            week-long seminar given by Dr. Wolfe. It was amazing! She explained the structure & function
                            of the brain and the learning process. More importantly she translated This information into
                            effective teaching practices.
                        </p>
                        <p> Upon completing this training, I became part of her Brainy Bunch and an official trainer of
                            Brain-Based Research & Compatible Teaching. This allowed me to present her specifically
                            designed materials to parents, teachers and community members, which is what I did happily.
                        </p>
                        <p> All of this leads me to always keep the young child’s brain in mind!

                        <h2>NEURON PLASTICITY            </h2>
                        <p>Inside a young child’s brain neurons have been working overtime creating synapses. Yes, an infant does have neuron pathways that support their key body functions-heartbeat, breathing etc. However, an enormous number of brain cells are unconnected to each other.--on standby—waiting for new pathways to get built </p>

                        <p>Life experiences and interactions with parents-caregivers 
in a child’s environment will cause synapse connections to occur. 
In these early years, the construction of mass highways or networks 
are beginning to appear at a fast pace. Information, sorting and MORE 
learning is taking place causing the brain to be newly “wired”!   </p>
<p>All the synapse pathways that are constructed do not become 
    permanent. Synapse connections strengthen with repetition! While the 
    opposite is true, inconsistent use or no use of one’s pathways weaken those 
    connections, causing them to fade away or be pruned. The brain’s ability to be 
    flexible, make changes and adapt is called neural plasticity. “The human brain is 
    continually altering its structure, cell number, circuitry, and chemistry as a 
    direct result of everything we do, experience, think and believe.” stated 
    Dr. Helena Popovic MBBS, medical doctor and author.</p>
    <p>Until the 1950’s scientists thought neuron development only took place throughout childhood and up to about the age of twenty-five Recent discoveries have shown that neuron structures and connections continue to expand all through one’s life. The generation of new neurons at an older age is certainly something to remember and celebrate!
    </p>
    <p>  “The brain is the only organ in the body that remains plastic throughout life and sculpts itself through its experiences” stated Pat. Wolfe & Pamela. Nevills, authors of Building the Reading Brain Pre-K- 3rd

                        </h3>
                        <p>As a 6 year old, I was excited to take piano lessons. It was fun and challenging but the practice, practice and more practice was NOT! With my continual attempts to play, finally short musical tunes flowed from our piano. The ever famous, Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star was one of my masterpieces! Time ticked slowly by, and the outside world began to call me. This for sure was no longer my desire. Soon my daily whining paid off and no more piano lessons. One knows how the story ends----my piano skills disappeared, 
                            sadly my neural pathways faded away--- off into the sunset! </p>
                            <p>PS Happily, new synapses fired off as roller skating 
                                took over my after-school time!
